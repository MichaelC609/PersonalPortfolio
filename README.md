A Simple landing page to showcase my education, experience and skills in Computer Science

The Project is split up into three folders:  
  - css: contains all the CSS files used to style the website
  - html: contains all the HTML files used to build the structure of the webpage
  - images: contains all the images used throughout the webpage

Within he 'html' folder, there are three main files:
  - home.html: contains the html for the homepage that the user first sees when visiting the page 
  - education.html: a page linked from the home page and the nav bar containing info about my education
  - experience.html: a page linked from the home page and the nav bar containing info about my relevant experience
                      and skills developed throughout coursework and hands on experience

Future Implementations: 
  - I plan on implementing a contact page that contains all my social media handles, github and linkedin links
  - I also plan on improving the User Interface and adding more features in the future
